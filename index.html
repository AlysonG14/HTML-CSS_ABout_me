            Hi, my name is Alyson Pereira dos Santos, and I have a deep passion for a variety of things. First and foremost, I love to play video games, which fuels my creativity and strategic thinking. When I'm not gaming, you’ll probably find me at the gym, training hard to stay in top physical shape, and diving into martial arts to hone my skills in both discipline and self-defense.
            On the tech side, I'm really into HTML & CSS, the building blocks of web development that help me create visually appealing, well-structured websites. I also dive into JavaScript, adding dynamic features and interactivity to my projects. If I want to build something more powerful, I use Python—it’s my go-to language for data projects, automation, and even some basic machine learning.
            When it comes to design, I love using Figma to create clean, functional user interfaces and prototypes, and Canva is my tool of choice for quick, visually engaging graphics. 
            Aside from tech and fitness, I’m an avid reader and I love books. They allow me to escape into different worlds, learn new things, and constantly improve myself. But what really gives me energy is music. I love listening to it because it feels like I’m transported to another world. The rush of adrenaline I get from certain beats or rhythms is just unmatched—it keeps me hyped and motivated.
            All of these interests combine to keep me inspired, challenged, and always learning!
